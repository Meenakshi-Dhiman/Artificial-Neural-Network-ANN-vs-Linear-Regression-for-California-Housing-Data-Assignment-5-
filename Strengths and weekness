Strengths and Weaknesses:
Linear Regression:
Strengths:

Interpretability: Linear Regression provides clear interpretability. The coefficients indicate the impact of each feature on the target variable.
Computationally Efficient: Linear Regression is computationally less intensive compared to complex models like ANN.
Weaknesses:

Assumes Linearity: Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target, which might not capture complex patterns in the data.
Limited Flexibility: It may not perform well when the relationship between variables is highly non-linear.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
Strengths:

Complex Patterns: ANN can capture intricate patterns in the data due to its non-linear activation functions and multiple hidden layers.
Adaptability: Can handle complex relationships without making strong assumptions about the data distribution.
Weaknesses:

Black-Box Nature: Interpretability can be challenging due to the complex, non-linear nature of ANN. Understanding how each feature influences predictions may not be straightforward.
Computational Complexity: Training an ANN can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets and complex architectures.
Analysis of Model Complexity:
Interpretability:
Linear Regression: Highly interpretable. Coefficients directly indicate the impact of each feature.
ANN: Less interpretable due to the complex relationships learned by hidden layers.
Computational Complexity:
Linear Regression: Low computational complexity, making it suitable for large datasets and real-time applications.
ANN: High computational complexity, especially with deep architectures. Training may require more time and resources.
Model Flexibility:
Linear Regression: Limited flexibility in capturing non-linear relationships.
ANN: Highly flexible, able to adapt to complex relationships without relying on specific assumptions.
Conclusion:
The choice between Linear Regression and ANN depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis.
